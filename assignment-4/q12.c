* Program/Purpose: Array that contains integer values, some of these 
  values are repeated with an even number of repetitions, 
  and only one value is repeated with an odd number of 
  repetitions. Write a C function thatâ€™s take the array as 
  input and the array size and return the number which has 
  odd numbers of repetitions.
